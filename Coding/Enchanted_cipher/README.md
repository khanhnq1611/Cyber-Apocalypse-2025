## Challenge overview

In this challenge, you are given an encoded message produced by an enchanted shifting cipher. The original plaintext consists of 3â€“7 randomly generated words, and the encryption process involves the following steps:

- **Grouping Characters:**  
  The plaintext is stripped of spaces and punctuation, and its alphabetical characters are grouped into segments of 5.
  
- **Shifting Letters:**  
  For each group, every letter is shifted by a random value between 1 and 25 (similar to a Caesar cipher). When a group ends, a new random shift is applied to the next group of 5 characters.
  
After the encoded message, two additional lines are provided:
1. The total number of shift groups applied.
2. A list of the random shift values used for each group.

**Your Task:**  
You must decode the encoded message by reversing the shifting process and restoring the original plaintext.
